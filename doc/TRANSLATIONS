Instructions for translating MagIRC
-----------------------------------

Use a gettext language file editor, such as POedit.
Create a new catalog using locale/smarty.c as source, or copy an existing language file.
Create a new directory for your locale, which also needs to contain a directory named LC_MESSAGES.
The language file must be named messages.mo

TODO: I know, these instructions suck, but will improve soon.
